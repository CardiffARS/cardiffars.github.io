One of the primary goals of CUARS is to promote RF engineering in an engaging, hands on and interactive way. We hope to acheive this through a variety of projects and activities.

Below you can find information on our current projects and activities.

Dirction finding

Direction finding (DF) is an international competative sport. Where a team or individual has to locate a number of hidden transmitters using basic equipment, namely: a receiver, directional antenna and (usually) an OS mapl. direction finding can be a small competition in an urban enviroment over 100's of meters or an international event covering 10's of miles over rough terrain in a national park!

The aim of direction finding is simple, find the hidden transmitters before your competition does!

CUARS organises regular DF competitions, it is a great way to hone your radio skills and meet new people!
