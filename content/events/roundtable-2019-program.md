## Talks

### Digital Pre-Distortion: Introduction and use
**[Derek Kozel](https://www.twitter.com/derekkozel) - MW0LNA**

Digital Pre-Distortion is a powerful technique to reduce the distortion and loss of SNR caused by the non-linear effects of amplifiers. This talk introduces the technique and shows how it can be used with Software Defined Radios and [GNU Radio](www.gnuradio.org).

### RF Power Amplifier Design Considerations for Amateur Radio 
Zack Costello

Modern RF power amplifier design typically involves extensive use of computer-aided design (CAD) tools, minimising the time and cost associated with prototyping. Use of RF test and measurement equipment is also an essential element of the design flow to verify performance and identify issues that may arise.

Commercial RF CAD packages and, in particular, measurement equipment are often unavailable to amateur radio operators due to both cost limitations and the necessary technical training required to effectively use these tools.

This talk will discuss PA design from an amateur radio perspective, looking at the fundamentals of PA design, the capabilities of current open-source RF CAD software, and highlighting some points of interest within the design flow.

### Advanced high efficiency power amplifier architectures for modern signals
David Collins - 2E0LXD

The power amplifier is often the largest consumer of energy in a radio system. So obtaining a high efficiency from the power amplifier is often a critical design criteria, especially when the system being designed is for portable applications where; low power consumption, compact design and thermal management are key.

Designing a power amplifier for high efficiency can be challenging, especially at microwave and mm wave frequencies and where other important design criteria such as linearity and maintaining high output power have to be considered. Often this leads to trade-offs and compromises having to be made. 

Doherty back in the 1930â€™s was the first to come up with a PA architecture that maintained high efficiency with non-constant envelope signals, in his case, MW AM broadcast transmitters. Since then modern digital modulation schemes such as OFDM and APSK (used in DVB) that have high peak to average power ratios and require high linearity have driven the research and design of high efficiency PA architectures.

This talk introduce the techniques and concepts for high efficiency power amplifier design. Some advanced PA architectures will be discussed and key design methodologies presented.
