### Wednesday February 13, 2019
#### 3 PM - 4:30 PM

We will be running a hidden transmitter hunt, also known as an Amateur Radio Direction Finding event. Checkout our [project page](/projects/rdf) for more information about direction finding but here's a quick summary.

We will be putting several small radio transmitters around Bute Park. These will be sending weak signals which will be audible to the searchers using receivers and directional antennas. We will provide all equipment and no previous experience is needed. There will be a brief introduction to the event, the receivers handed out, and we'll walk to the entrance of Bute Park. From there groups will have a set amount of time to find as many transmitters as possible. We will meet up back at the entrance and move somewhere warmer to chat about future hunts and radio activities. 

This search is entirely for fun, but at times it is useful and necessary to find the sources of interference on the radio frequencies we use for the rest of our activities. This can be locally within a room or building, such as a badly designed power supply, or miles away such as a pirate radio station. Additionally search and rescue teams sometimes use the same techniques to find hikers who have radios or emergency beacons with them.
