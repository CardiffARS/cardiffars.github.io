## Venue 

The Roundtable was held in the West and South Queen's Buildings of Cardiff University's engineering department.

Entrance to the buildings is in the carpark as marked by the blue label. No other entrances to the buildings will be unlocked so if you are on-foot please walk around to the carpark. There are stairs and an elevator from the carpark to the ENGIN Forum on the first floor. The talks room is just next door to the Forum.

Tea and Coffee, Lunch, trading tables, and the measurement setup were in the ENGIN Forum.

We were able to reserve much of the private university carpark and this accomodated all attendees who drove. The entrance is off of West Grove street, use **5 The Parade CF24 3AA** in your satnav. Security will know that the Roundtable is happening, mention the Cardiff University Amateur Radio Society if they ask who is running the event.
