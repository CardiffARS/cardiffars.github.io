The schedule is still being finalized but the following times and structure are expected to be representative. We recommend looking at last year's [schedule](/events/2019/roundtable/program) to see the type of talks which happened.

## Talks

### Gallium Nitride and RF Power Devices
Dr Khaled Elgaid FIET, SIEEE

The semiconductor engineering of high frequency devices and integrated circuits in the GHz world - Full Description Coming

### Building a 1.3 GHz beacon for Cardiff
Ahmed Kamal and Shem Kalele

Third year students in Cardiff University's Electronics Engineering program complete a course in which they design and build a project. Ahmed has been implementing the PI4 beacon modulation in Python and GNU Radio to be transmitted from an Analog Devices ADALM PLUTO SDR. Shem is designing a 25 Watt amplifier using a Cree GaN transistor. They'll give a report on the progress and learning experience..

### Interlacing and HD for the DATV Express and LimeSDR
#### Do try this at home!
Phil Longhurst GW8BVI

Interlacing is a 1930's technique which has a lot of benefits and is still in use today (1080i HD). But it is a pain to get it right and if you don't the results look terrible! Using paid s/w (Vmix) and free s/w (OBS broadcaster) it can be done if you know how. 1080i HD looks fab and can be transmitted via a mere 1MS/s DVB-S2 with low-latency h.264 (not even the latest 4K HEVC) phys channel.

### Tracking and Measuring Distances with LoRa at 2.4 GHz
Stuart Robinson GW7HPW

A brief introduction to using the Semtech 2.4 GHz LoRa devices for long distance high altitude balloon tracking and measurement of distance by time of flight of a packet exchange. 

### Transistor Load Lines at Home 
Alex Alt

The Current-Voltage load line of a transitor tells you lots of information about how it will perform in an amplifier, but often aren't included in datasheets. Learn what these useful measurements mean and how to take them using simple equipment. This talk shows how load lines can be used in amplifier design, starting with the measurements of IV curves and ending with an overview of how they can be used in high efficiency PAs.


## Breaks

The ENGIN Forum will be open all day and had refreshments during breaks. There will be space for swapmeet tables and organization booths. Bring a build or demo to share! 

There will be a variety of microwave test equipment setup to make measurements of attendees items. We expect to have even more than last year.

Instrument    | Range
--------------|------
Two port VNA |  2 MHz to 6 GHz (PAs only to 2.4 GHz and 50 Watts due to available attenuators)
Frequency Counter |  10 Hz to 26.5 GHz
Power Meter  | 10 MHz to 26.5 GHz
Noise Figure | 10 MHz to 1.6 GHz (noise source to 18 GHz)
Signal Generator | 100 kHz to 40 GHz (Two tone capable)
Rubidium | 10 MHz reference (all devices will be locked to it)
Digital Multi Meters | 8.5 digits DC & AC current and voltage, resistance - 5.5 digit capacitance
