## Direction Finding Treasure Hunt

In February as part of the spring students activity fair we will be running a direction finding event. Several small transmitters will be hidden around Bute Park and the challenge is to locate them all using directional antennas.

## [Microwave Roundtable](/events/2019/roundtable)

CUARS will be hosting a meeting of the [UK Microwave Group](http://www.microwavers.org) in March of 2019 at our campus in Cardiff. This one day event is a mix of talks, measurements, and socializing about activities in the GHz frequencies.
