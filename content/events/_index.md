## [Direction Finding Treasure Hunt](/events/2019/giag-ardf)

On February 13th we ran a direction finding event. Several small transmitters were hidden around Bute Park and the challenge was to locate them all using directional antennas.

## [Microwave Roundtable](/events/2019/roundtable)

CUARS hosted a meeting of the [UK Microwave Group](http://www.microwavers.org) in March of 2019 at our campus in Cardiff. This one day event was a mix of talks, measurements, and socializing about activities in the GHz frequencies. All of the slides and files from the event are posted on the program page
