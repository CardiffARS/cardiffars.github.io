The Cardiff Amateur Radio Society is based at Cardiff University and aims to provide a home and resources for all areas of the Amateur Radio hobby as well as RF experimentation in other bands and licences. The group is open to all Cardiff University students, faculty, and staff. We meet regularily during the school year and organize events and activities on campus and around the UK. We are affiliated with both the Radio Society of Great Britain and the Cardiff University Students' Union.

We meet in the Queen's Buildings for our regular and project sessions.

> CF24 3AA

Currently we do not have a permanent location at the university for our equipment so meet in the Queen's Buildings. 

We have a leadership committee which keeps the wheels turning:

> **President**: Derek Kozel, MW0LNA  
> **Secretary**: Zack Costello  
> **Treasurer**: David Collins, 2E0LXD  

To contact us off the air for any reason, you can send email to officers@cardiffars.org.uk or directly to one of us at \<position\>@cardiffars.org.uk

Catch the latest news from us on Twitter at [@CardiffARS](https://www.twitter.com/cardiffars) or (less active) on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cardiffars/).
