The Cardiff University Amateur Radio Society is based at Cardiff University and aims to provide a home and resources for all areas of the Amateur Radio hobby and RF experimentation in other bands and licences. The group is open to all Cardiff University students, faculty, and staff. We meet regularily during the school year and organize events and activities in Cardiff and around the UK. We are affiliated with both the Radio Society of Great Britain and the Cardiff University Students' Union.

We meet up every **Thursday at 6 PM** online for our regular and project sessions. Come any time, there's usually not a formal activity.
