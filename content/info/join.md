Before anything else, come along to a meeting or an event. There's only so much we can put onto the website and there's lots to see. Send us an email at officers@cardiffars.org.uk and we can tell you what's happening soon. If you aren't university affiliated also send us an email, there's lots of ways of being involved.

We meet every Wednesday from 4-6 PM. Checkout the [about](/info/) page for the location details.

Once you've met us and know you're interested, we are affiliated with the [Cardiff University Student's Union](https://www.cardiffstudents.com/) and you can join us through them.
