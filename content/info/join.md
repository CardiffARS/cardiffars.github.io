We are in the process of affiliating ourselves with the [Cardiff University Student's Union](https://www.cardiffstudents.com/) but until that process is complete you can express your interest and have us send you some more information by joining us using this [**Google Form**](https://goo.gl/forms/4DznicRovSRZ3pu83). There are no membership dues or obligations when joining, all we'll do is let you know when our next meeting is and some pointers to finding out more about what we're up to.

If you do not want to use the Google Form please complete this [PDF Membership Form](/info/Membership Application Form.pdf) and email it to &#111;&#102;&#102;&#105;&#099;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#099;&#097;&#114;&#100;&#105;&#102;&#102;&#097;&#114;&#115;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#046;&#117;&#107;.
