We are affiliated with the [Cardiff University Student's Union](https://www.cardiffstudents.com/) and membership will be handled through there very soon.

In the meanwhile you can express your interest and have us send you some more information by joining us using this [**Google Form**](https://goo.gl/forms/4DznicRovSRZ3pu83). There are no membership dues or obligations when joining, all we'll do is let you know when our next meeting is and some pointers to finding out more about what we're up to.
