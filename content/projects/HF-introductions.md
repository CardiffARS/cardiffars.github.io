A request to any ham: I'm making a demo for CardiffARS and need recordings of people introducing themselves and talking about their interests in the hobby. If you're willing and able could you send me one of you? ~30s to 2min

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/679507700&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

I'm making an IQ file of all the recordings modulated as FM, SSB, and FreeDV and will set it on loop in SDRAngel. Students can then tune to the different signals and hear different perspectives on the hobby. 

Hoping for something along the lines of this, but completely open to however you'd like to tell your story.
