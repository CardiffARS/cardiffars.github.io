Direction Finding (DF) is an international competative sport where a team or individual has to locate a number of hidden transmitters using basic equipment, namely: a receiver, directional antenna and (usually) a map. Direction finding can be a small competition in an urban enviroment over 100's of meters or a large event covering 10's of miles over rough terrain in a national park!

The aim of direction finding is simple, find the hidden transmitters before your competition does! For more information check out the RSGB page at the [National Radio Centre](http://www.nationalradiocentre.co.uk/ardf/). Wikipedia also has a good page on [Amateur radio direction finding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_direction_finding).

CUARS organises regular DF competitions, it is a great way to hone your radio skills and meet new people! Food and drinks are generally close to the final transmitter.

## Transmitters

CUARS plans to build six [TRO-2](http://open-circuit.co.uk/wp/transmitters/tro2-v6/) transmitters. These produce a programmable [On-Off-Keyed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-off_keying) signal using a PIC microcontroller.

We have the circuit boards and need to order the components and assemble them. We hope to complete this in time to use them in the fall semester.
