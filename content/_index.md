The Cardiff University Amateur Radio Society is open to all university students, faculty, and staff with an interest in amateur radio and wireless technology. We meet weekly during the school year and offer regular amateur radio licensing exam sessions on campus for the Cardiff University community and the general public. We have a dedicated room for our radios and activities, find out more on the [Club Info](/info) page.

Interested in joining us? To become a member, you simply need to attend one club meetup and one other club event, such as a "get-on-the-air" night or a workshop session. We have loaner radios ranging from handheld voice communications to advanced Software Defined Radios.
