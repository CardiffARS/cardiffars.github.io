The Cardiff University Amateur Radio Society is open to all university students, faculty, and staff with an interest in amateur radio. We meet monthly during the school year and offer regular amateur radio licensing exam sessions on campus for the Cardiff University community and the general public. We do not yet have a dedicated radio shack so tend towards portable operation and lab activities.

Interested in joining us? To become a member, you simply need to attend one club meeting and one other club event, such as a "get-on-the-air" night or a workshop session. If you don't have your own radio equipment, you can borrow ours.
